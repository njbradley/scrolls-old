This is version 0.2 of scrolls alpha: the adventure game!

Getting started:
To play the game, double click on main.exe. A window should pop up with a new world open.
The controls are listed below, so walk around and explore! there isn't much to do yet, 
but you have a crafting table if you get bored of exploring. See if you can get stone!

Settings:
in the folder saves/ there is a file called settings.txt, which has all of the game wide 
settings, like fullscreen, screen dimentions, max fps. If the window is to big for the 
screen, mess with the dimentions or go into fullscreen mode

Crashing:
Unfortunately, this game has a lot of bugs, and it sometimes crashes. If the game crashes
every time you start it, it might be incompadable with your computer. If you are willing, 
send me an email at nicholasjohnsonbradley@gmail.com with some info about your computer, 
and I can work to get it working.
